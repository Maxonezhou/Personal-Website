                        One of the largest threats to firefighters is the inability to effectively monitor several different environmental vitals 
                        at the same time. Additional equipment and communication devices used by firefighters increase bulk and impede their ability 
                        to move when stuck in tough situations. Our team sought to tackle this issue by developing a novel, lightweight solution for 
                        firefighters keep track of important vitals and provide a central location to monitor the health of all the firefighters
                        at the same time. Built for Hack the North 2019, Guardian is a novel helmet designed to advance current firefighting methods. 
                        By attaching various crucial sensors on the helmet, we are able to gather important vitals about the environment such as temperature, 
                        CO2 levels, atmospheric pressure, volume of total organic compounds, and much more while simultaneously sending this data in real-time 
                        over the Internet of Things platform to a remote database. We then retrieved this information and created a unique web user interface 
                        that responded to the real-time changes in data to relay information across all individuals over watching the situation.

                        The Guardian firefighter helmet sends and retrieves information by using six sensors connected to a central microcontroller 
                        (NodeMCU ESP8266) capable of connecting to nearby WiFi networks. When information from the environment is extracted, we are 
                        able to send this information using WiFi following the IoT protocol to a remote Google Firebase real-time database where it is stored 
                        and processed. When this information is retrieved, it is used to create a VueJS web user interface that displays the information 
                        in a real-time UI to show changes as they happen. This interface allows all subscribers to the web app to monitor the 
                        situation different firefighters are and providing assistance when needed.

                        The microcontroller we used for this project is the NodeMCU board which is an Internet of Things enabled board built on top of the Arduino framework. We then attached several sensors to the board (DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor, CCS811 Air Quality Sensor, BME280 Atmospheric and Pressure Sensor, and VEML6070 UV Index Sensor) following the I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol where we used a multi-master/multi-slave architecture to allow sensors to publish and receive data to the bus system. When the data is received by the NodeMCU microcontroller, the data is sent over WiFi to a real-time Google Firebase database where it is categorized by sensor and type of data. This information is then retrieved and displayed on a web app user interface updated in real-time. The web app is built using the Vue.js framework to process the real-time data. Other areas of the web app such as the front-end design are built using the HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. Additional features were implemented using Bootstrap, and ApexGraphs.

                        Throughout the project, our team ran into several challenges regarding the hardware aspect of the implementation of the helmet. As this was our first time using the IOT framework, we found it difficult in the beginning to find a method of connecting to WiFi. When we initially tried to use an Arduino Uno board and connected an ESP8266 WiFi module to it, we found that the setup required to connect to Google Firebase required several external frameworks that we were unable to implement. As a result, we switched over to the NodeMCU board which had the ESP8266 WiFi chip already built into the board. However, since this is a much smaller microcontroller, the number of input and output data pins was half of that of the Arduino Uno. In order to counteract this, our team members learned to use the I2C protocol which allowed us to connect several sensors to only one bus and save the input and output pins.

                        This project taught us the importance of communication protocols. Since we had team members working on the software side as well as team members working on the hardware side. It was crucial for us to establish a communication protocol early on in the project as it is difficult for both teams to work on the project simultaneously if the software team was not retrieving data from the hardware team. In order to overcome this, we made sure to establish a solid form of communication of data so the software team knew exactly how to fetch the data and what format it would be in. By doing this, as the hardware team was integrating more sensors, the software team was able to generate their own faux data following the same communication protocol before real data was provided. This made integrating the two sides of the project at the end very easy and efficient.
